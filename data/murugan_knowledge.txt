Lord Murugan (முருகன்) is a Hindu deity revered by Tamils worldwide, known as the god of war and youth. His six primary temples, known as Arupadai Veedu (ஆறுபடை வீடு), include Tirupparankunram, Tiruchendur, Palani, Swamimalai, Thiruthani, and Pazhamudircholai. Thaipusam (தைப்பூசம்) is a major festival where devotees carry Kavadi (காவடி) to honor Murugan. Among Thamizh Muppattan (தமிழ் முப்பாட்டன்) in Mauritius, Murugan worship includes vibrant processions at temples like Sockalingum Meenatchee Ammen Kovil. In Sri Lanka, Eezham Thamizh Muruga Valipadu (ஈழத் தமிழ் முருக வழிபாடு) centers around Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil, with festivals like Kanda Shasti.
